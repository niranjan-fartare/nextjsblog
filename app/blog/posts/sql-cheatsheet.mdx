# Complete SQL Cheatsheet

## Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. This cheatsheet covers everything from basic concepts to advanced features.

## Basic Concepts

### Database Fundamentals
A database is an organized collection of structured data, similar to interconnected spreadsheets. Each spreadsheet represents a table containing rows (records) and columns (fields).

### Database Operations
```sql
-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE school;

-- Switch to a database
USE school;

-- Delete a database
DROP DATABASE school;
```

## Table Operations

### Creating Tables
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 0),
    grade DECIMAL(4,2),
    enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```

### Table Structure
```sql
-- View table structure
DESCRIBE students;
-- or
DESC students;
```

## Data Manipulation

### Insert Data
```sql
-- Single row insert
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, grade)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 18, 85.5);

-- Multiple row insert
INSERT INTO students (first_name, last_name, age, grade) VALUES 
('Jane', 'Smith', 19, 92.5),
('Bob', 'Johnson', 20, 88.0);
```

### Select Data
```sql
-- Basic select
SELECT * FROM students;

-- Select specific columns
SELECT first_name, last_name, grade FROM students;

-- Select with conditions
SELECT first_name, last_name, grade 
FROM students 
WHERE grade >= 90;

-- Select with multiple conditions
SELECT first_name, last_name, grade 
FROM students 
WHERE grade >= 90 AND age < 20;
```

### Update Data
```sql
-- Update all matching records
UPDATE students 
SET grade = grade + 5 
WHERE grade < 70;

-- Update multiple columns
UPDATE students 
SET 
    grade = 95,
    last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE id = 1;
```

### Delete Data
```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM students 
WHERE grade < 50;

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM students;
```

## Advanced Queries

### Filtering with WHERE
```sql
-- Basic comparison
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age >= 18;

-- Pattern matching
SELECT * FROM students WHERE last_name LIKE 'S%';

-- Multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE grade >= 90 
AND (age < 20 OR last_name LIKE 'S%');

-- IN operator
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE age IN (18, 19, 20);

-- BETWEEN operator
SELECT * FROM students 
WHERE grade BETWEEN 80 AND 90;
```

### Sorting and Grouping
```sql
-- Sort by one column
SELECT * FROM students 
ORDER BY grade DESC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM students 
ORDER BY grade DESC, age ASC;

-- Group by with aggregates
SELECT 
    age,
    COUNT(*) as student_count,
    AVG(grade) as average_grade
FROM students
GROUP BY age
HAVING AVG(grade) >= 80;
```

## Joins

### Types of Joins
```sql
-- INNER JOIN
SELECT 
    s.first_name,
    s.last_name,
    c.course_name,
    e.grade
FROM students s
INNER JOIN enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
INNER JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id;

-- LEFT JOIN
SELECT 
    s.first_name,
    s.last_name,
    c.course_name
FROM students s
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON s.id = e.student_id
LEFT JOIN courses c ON e.course_id = c.id;
```

## Advanced Features

### Subqueries
```sql
-- Subquery in WHERE
SELECT first_name, last_name, grade
FROM students
WHERE grade > (SELECT AVG(grade) FROM students);

-- Subquery in FROM
SELECT dept_name, avg_grade
FROM (
    SELECT d.name as dept_name, AVG(s.grade) as avg_grade
    FROM departments d
    JOIN students s ON d.id = s.dept_id
    GROUP BY d.id
) as dept_averages
WHERE avg_grade > 85;
```

### Views
```sql
-- Create a view
CREATE VIEW honor_students AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, grade
FROM students
WHERE grade >= 90;

-- Query from view
SELECT * FROM honor_students;
```

### Indexes
```sql
-- Create index
CREATE INDEX idx_student_name 
ON students(last_name, first_name);

-- Create unique index
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_email 
ON students(email);
```

## Data Types

### Numeric Types
```sql
-- Integer types
TINYINT    -- -128 to 127
SMALLINT   -- -32,768 to 32,767
INT        -- -2^31 to 2^31-1
BIGINT     -- -2^63 to 2^63-1

-- Decimal types
DECIMAL(10,2)  -- 10 digits total, 2 after decimal
FLOAT          -- Approximate numeric
DOUBLE         -- Double precision float
```

### String Types
```sql
-- String types
CHAR(10)       -- Fixed-length string
VARCHAR(255)   -- Variable-length string
TEXT           -- Long text
ENUM('S','M','L') -- List of possible values
```

### Date/Time Types
```sql
-- Date and time types
DATE           -- YYYY-MM-DD
TIME           -- HH:MM:SS
DATETIME       -- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
TIMESTAMP      -- Stores as UTC
```

## Transactions

### Basic Transactions
```sql
-- Basic transaction
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

-- Transaction with rollback
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
-- Something goes wrong
ROLLBACK;
```

## Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
```sql
WITH high_performers AS (
    SELECT dept_id, AVG(grade) as avg_grade
    FROM students
    GROUP BY dept_id
    HAVING AVG(grade) > 85
)
SELECT d.name, hp.avg_grade
FROM departments d
JOIN high_performers hp ON d.id = hp.dept_id;
```

## Window Functions
```sql
-- Row number by grade
SELECT 
    first_name,
    grade,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY grade DESC) as rank
FROM students;

-- Running total
SELECT 
    first_name,
    grade,
    SUM(grade) OVER (ORDER BY id) as running_total
FROM students;
```

## Database Security

### User Management
```sql
-- Create user
CREATE USER 'john'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';

-- Grant privileges
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON school.students TO 'john'@'localhost';

-- Revoke privileges
REVOKE INSERT ON school.students FROM 'john'@'localhost';
```

## Performance Tips

### 1. Indexing Best Practices
- Create indexes on frequently searched columns
- Avoid over-indexing (slows down INSERT/UPDATE)
- Regular index maintenance

### 2. Query Optimization
- Select only needed columns (avoid SELECT *)
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze query performance
- Implement efficient WHERE clauses
- Use appropriate JOINs

### 3. Table Design
- Normalize data to reduce redundancy
- Use appropriate data types
- Set proper constraints
- Regular database maintenance

## Conclusion
This cheatsheet covers the essential aspects of SQL, from basic operations to advanced features. Remember to always consider performance implications and security best practices when working with databases.
