Hello!

I've accumulated some RIPE Atlas credits, and instead of letting them sit idle, I'd love to share them with people who genuinely need them.

Whether you're a student, researcher, hobbyist, or network engineer using RIPE Atlas for diagnostics, measurements, or experimentation — this is for you!


## Who Can Request?

Anyone with a legitimate use case for RIPE Atlas credits:

- Running measurements (ping, traceroute, DNS, etc.)
- Contributing to open research or community tools
- Learning or experimenting with internet infrastructure


## How to Request

Just send an email with the subject "RIPE Atlas Credits" to [me@niranjan.co](mailto:me@niranjan.co)

Please include the following details:

- Your RIPE Atlas account email or username
- A brief summary of how you plan to use the credits
- An approximate number of credits you’d need

## A Small Note

This is a manual, goodwill-based giveaway. Please don’t spam or request if you don’t actually plan to use the credits. I’ll prioritize thoughtful and genuine requests.

Thanks for understanding!
